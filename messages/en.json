    "description": "Our team is a close-knit group of professionals who came together to create REST Client. This REST client was developed as part of the REACT course at RS School. Our REST client supports method selection, URLs, and headers. Additional components of our application include: Authorization and authentication capabilities, ensuring that access to the tool is limited to authorized users. A history section that redirects the user to a specific section for previously executed requests. We used agile methodologies, collaborative planning, and effective communication to achieve success. Below are the project participants, their roles, and contributions:",
